/**
 * DEV-ONLY seed data for the admin dashboard.

 * Pure data — no Convex APIs. The seeder in `convex/seed.ts` imports these

 * prefix so the seeder can clear and re-run idempotently without touching real
 * users or requests created through the app.
 *
 * Requests and notifications reference users by a stable local `handle` (e.g.
 * `vol-amara`), NOT by document id — the seeder resolves handles to the
 * `Id<"users">` values produced at insert time.
