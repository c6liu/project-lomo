# AGENTS.md

AI agent instructions for the LoMo project. This is the single source of truth — `CLAUDE.md` symlinks here. Each app has its own `AGENTS.md` for app-specific conventions.

## Project Overview

LoMo is a calm, consent-based community help platform (CivicTechWR Season 7). Bun monorepo orchestrated by Turborepo. Early stage — most features are not yet built.

## Monorepo Layout

```
project-lomo/
  apps/lomoweb/                  @repo/lomoweb                Next.js 16 + Convex + Better Auth
  apps/convex-backend/           @repo/convex-backend         Convex backend-as-a-service
  packages/ui/                   @repo/ui                     Design system: Tailwind v4 + react-aria-components
  packages/eslint-config/        @repo/eslint-config          Shared ESLint config (antfu)
```

See `apps/lomoweb/AGENTS.md` and `packages/ui/AGENTS.md` for app-specific instructions.

## Code Quality Standards

- When you run lint/typecheck/tests and they fail, fix ALL failures — even in files you didn't touch. You own the build, not just your diff.
- After creating or modifying any rule, config, or behavior — VERIFY it works. Write a test, create a mock, or run a concrete example. Never assume correctness.
- If you can't verify something in the current environment, say so explicitly and explain what verification is needed — don't just say "should be fine."
- Treat every change as if the person won't revisit it later. If something related is broken or unverified, handle it now.
- When a UI copy or layout change is intentional, do not keep tests pinned to the old contract. Prefer assertions for current user-facing behavior, accessibility, and semantics over brittle exact-text or legacy DOM structure assumptions. Stale tests are a common false failure when product wording or markup evolves.

### Test contract drift rule

A failing UI test is not always a product regression. Sometimes the app is correct and the test is stale.

Common examples:
- exact text assertions that no longer match the current marketing copy
- `data-testid` expectations for a layout that has intentionally changed (for example from cards to list items)
- legacy heading names or section labels after a UX refinement

When this happens:
- verify whether the change is intentional
- update the test to the current contract
- assert the current behavior in user-visible terms (roles, labels, order, semantics), not legacy implementation details

This keeps tests stable as the product evolves without turning them into a lock on old wording or older component structure.

## Commands

Run all commands from the repo root. **Always target specific packages** using `bun --filter=<package_name>` instead of running monorepo-wide commands or cd-ing into directories.

### Targeting a specific package

```bash
bun --filter=@repo/lomoweb run lint
bun --filter=@repo/lomoweb run test
bun --filter=@repo/convex-backend run build
bun --filter=@repo/ui run lint:fix
```

### Monorepo-wide commands (via Turbo)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun run dev` | Start all apps in Turbo TUI |
| `bun run build` | Build all packages |
| `bun run lint` | Lint all packages |
| `bun run lint:fix` | Auto-fix lint issues |

### Fixing lint errors

1. **Always run `lint:fix` first** — most issues (formatting, import order, quotes, semicolons) are auto-fixable:
   ```bash
   bun --filter=@repo/<package> run lint:fix
   ```
2. **Then run `lint`** to see what remains:
   ```bash
   bun --filter=@repo/<package> run lint
   ```
3. Only manually resolve errors that survive auto-fix.

### Installing dependencies

**Do NOT run `bun install` directly.** Ask the user to review dependency changes and run it themselves.

## Local Dev Setup

When a user asks you to set up their local environment, run these steps in order:

**Step 1 — Copy the frontend env file** (skip if `apps/lomoweb/.env.local` already exists):
```bash
cp apps/lomoweb/.env.local.example apps/lomoweb/.env.local
```

**Step 2 — Set the required Convex environment variables** (run from repo root):
```bash
bunx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000 --project-dir apps/convex-backend
bunx convex env set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32) --project-dir apps/convex-backend
```

These are stored in Convex's deployment config, not in a local file. They only need to be set once per deployment; rerunning them is safe and simply replaces the existing values.

**Step 3 — Start the app stack**:
```bash
bun run dev
```

This launches the monorepo apps, including the Convex backend.

**Step 4 — Seed the local database** (after the backend has started successfully):
```bash
cd apps/convex-backend
npx convex run seed:run
```

This populates the local database with the built-in demo users, help requests, and notifications for local development. Rerunning it resets the seeded data to the default fixtures.

If you want to remove only the seed data without reinserting it:
```bash
cd apps/convex-backend
npx convex run seed:clear
```

## Do NOT

- Do NOT commit `.env` files
- Do NOT run `bun install` — prompt and wait for the user to review and install dependencies themselves

## Pending Decisions

These are not yet decided. Do not introduce them without explicit instruction:

- Frontend hosting: Vercel vs Cloudflare vs Railway


## External References

Two reference repos are cloned locally. Always prefer reading these over fetching from the internet.

### Radix UI Themes — design reference

- **Repo:** [radix-ui/themes](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes)
- **Local path:** `~/refs/themes`
- **Role:** Visual design patterns only — we do not depend on Radix at runtime.

What we reference:

- **Color scale semantics** — which of the 12 steps to use for backgrounds, borders, solid fills, text
- **Component variant naming** — e.g., solid/soft/outline/ghost styles
- **Token scales** — the structure of radius, typography, and spacing ramps
- **Prop conventions** — numeric size scales, color-as-prop pattern

Consult when adding new components or extending the design token system.

### React Spectrum — component reference

- **Repo:** [adobe/react-spectrum](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum) (includes React Aria, React Stately, and React Aria Components)
- **Local path:** `~/refs/react-spectrum`
- **Role:** We depend on the `react-aria-components` npm package at runtime for accessible primitives. The repo is a reference for understanding internals, composition patterns, and context architecture.

What we reference:

- **Component composition** — how primitives are composed (slots, render props, context providers)
- **Context patterns** — how group components pass state and style to children
- **Accessibility** — ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Architecture patterns** — separation of concerns (e.g., layout vs semantics, hooks vs components)

For how our components are built (props, styling, variants), follow `@repo/ui`'s own conventions in `packages/ui/AGENTS.md`. React Aria Components provides the accessible foundation; Radix Themes informs the visual design language.

<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.
