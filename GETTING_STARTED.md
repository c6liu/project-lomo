# Getting Started with LoMo

This guide walks you through setting up the LoMo project for local development.

## Prerequisites

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.8+** — package manager and runtime
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >=22** — required runtime
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com) 2.30+**

To verify:

```bash
bun --version
node --version
git --version
```

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CivicTechWR/project-lomo.git
cd project-lomo
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Create the frontend environment file

```bash
cp apps/lomoweb/.env.local.example apps/lomoweb/.env.local
```

This is the local Next.js env file for the app. The defaults work for local development.

### 4. Set the required Convex environment variables

From the repo root, set the variables the backend needs before starting the dev server:

```bash
cd apps/convex-backend
bunx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000
bunx convex env set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

These values are stored in Convex's deployment config, not in a local file, so you typically only need to run this once per deployment. If the first `bun run dev` fails with `SITE_URL is missing or invalid`, this is the missing setup step.

### 5. Grant yourself admin access

Set your email as an admin in Convex's cloud config:

```bash
bunx convex env set ADMIN_EMAILS "your@email.com"
```

Replace `your@email.com` with the email you'll use to sign up. You can add multiple admins as a comma-separated list (e.g. `"alice@example.com,bob@example.com"`).

After this, signing in with that email gives you access to the admin panel at `/app/admin`.

### 6. (Optional) Seed test data for the admin dashboard

```bash
bunx convex run seed:run
```

This inserts sample users, requests, messages, and notifications so the admin dashboard has content to display. It's idempotent — safe to re-run anytime.

Seeded requests carry a spread of deadlines (`neededByInDays` in `apps/convex-backend/convex/lib/seedData.ts`, resolved relative to seed time) — including one already overdue and unmatched, and one no-deadline request — so the admin dashboard has something to show under every "needs attention" case without waiting for real data to accumulate.

### 7. Start everything

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts the monorepo apps and launches the Convex local dev process for the backend.

### 6. Seed the database

Once Convex is running and the backend has finished its initial push, seed the local database:

```bash
cd apps/convex-backend
npx convex run seed:run
```

This inserts the built-in demo users, requests, and notifications used for local development. You can rerun it anytime to reset the seeded data back to the default fixtures.

### 7. Optional cleanup

To remove only the seeded rows without reinserting them:

```bash
cd apps/convex-backend
npx convex run seed:clear
```

## What `bun run dev` starts

Turborepo starts all apps in the monorepo and opens a terminal UI for managing log views. Each process gets its own log panel instead of a single interleaved stream, making it easy to monitor individual apps.

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun run dev` | Start all apps in Turbo's terminal UI |
| `bun run build` | Build all packages |
| `bun run lint` | Lint all packages |
| `bun run lint:fix` | Auto-fix lint issues |
| `bun --filter=@repo/lomoweb run test` | Run the Next.js app test suite |

## Convex Backend

The backend uses [Convex](https://docs.convex.dev), a backend-as-a-service platform. See the [Convex documentation](https://docs.convex.dev) for details on deployment and configuration beyond local dev.
